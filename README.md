Includes two pcb's, upper and lower. All SMD components will be soldered. AT28C64 EEPROM is included (not programmed) Happy to program it with a supplied ROM or you could possibly do it through your existing monitor.

Board headers/interconnects are included but not soldered.

You will need to solder this stack onto your Z80 CPU.

Memory map has not yet been finalised though the hardware supports 2k granularity over the 64k address space, and 8k SRAM granularity over the full 128k. This means you can enable and disable the ROM and or RAM in 2k aligned boundaries, and you can put any one of 16, 8k blocks of RAM in any of the 8k boundaries. If this is confusing, comment down below.

Full source will be available for you to modify the CPLD code. The CPLD will come programmed.

In short, this kit can allow an 8kbyte monitor and 128k of accessible SRAM. With a serial board it can transfer ROM's to any address and boot them including all original TEC ROMs, CPM, Basic, Forth? etc...

Price will be $30 plus post. 9 will be available and orders will close (parts ordered) at the end of the week. Comment to reserve your kit.

The memory map will be configurable while the system is running
